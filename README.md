 ## Assignment Overview

The assignment consisted of **3 parts and their subparts**:

### Part A
- **Research Writing** under 350 words: Arguing why general-purpose LLMs are incapable in clinical mental healthcare.
- **Formulating a loss function** that penalises major errors significantly more than minor.
- How to visualise model uncertainty in a medical app UI to assist doctors.

### Part B
- **Design of a data processing pipeline** for the given dataset to be processed in a particular format. Also, explain which data structure you used and why.

### Part C
- **PyTorch coding**: Changing the behaviour of LLM at inference without finetuning and reducing model hallucination for medical questions. Choosing an internal component and applying a filter on it for hallucination dampening.
- **Explaining the architecture** and data flow of LLM used in the above task in detail. [ I used `TinyLlama-1 1.1B`]
